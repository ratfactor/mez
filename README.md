# mez = meow-elf-zig

This is a one-off utility (at least so far) written in Zig
to help me debug the 32-bit ELF executables I'm exporting
from
<a href="https://ratfactor.com/meow5/">Meow5</a>,
my toy language experiment.

This tool is highly specific to solving a bug I'm currently
working through.
